# The ((((@classmethod)))) decorator in Python is used to define a method that is bound to the class,
# rather than an instance of the class. This means that when you call a class method,
# it takes the class itself as its first argument, typically named cls.

# @classmethod allows the method to operate on the class itself and not on individual instances.
# It is used when you need to perform actions or computations related to the class
# rather than any particular instance of the class.
# You can access and modify class-level attributes inside a class method using the cls parameter.


# The ((((@staticmethod)))) decorator in Python is used to define a method that does not depend on the instance or the class itself.
# It works like a regular function but is placed inside the class for organizational purposes.

# It is useful when you need a utility function that logically belongs to the class
# but doesnâ€™t need to access or modify class or instance attributes.
# It is more like a normal function but is kept inside the class for better organization.


# In Python, cls and self are used in different contexts, though both serve as references within a class.
# Here's the distinction:

# self:

# Refers to the instance of the class.
# It is used in instance methods to access or modify the instance's attributes and methods.
# Every instance method of a class has self as its first parameter, 
# which allows it to operate on the specific instance of the class.

# cls:

# Refers to the class itself.
# It is used in class methods, which are methods that operate on the class level, rather than on instances.
# Class methods are decorated with @classmethod, and the first argument is conventionally cls,
# which allows access to class attributes and other class methods.
